please upload the arduino code (pan_tilt_auto_four.ino) into the arduino board
after connecting the device with computer, run test_face_detect_two.py in your computer.
the fer2013 dataset can be download from the link provide in the fer2013_LINK folder
Please refer to the /**/ for the hardware connection

I have searched more than 200 websites, and I would like to list out several useful ones in MLA citation format. Every effort has been made to trace copyright, but in the event of any accidental infringement, I shall be pleased to come to a suitable arrangement with the rightful owner.
I am grateful to the following people who like to share good stuff with others.

1.	Adrian at ‘PyimageSearch’: He provides several examples about how to use the OpenCV library for computer vision project, which is inspiring, and I have learnt some applications of computer vision.
Website: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/

2.	Jeff Goergen: At the very first stage of the design process, I found his YouTube channel and I am fascinated about his project. Although I have not examined his code, he provided a list of hardware used and provide a brief diagram about how the components are connected in his Github repository. I finally bought the MG995 servo motors and a Pan/Tilt assembly, and a webcam online.

3.	ABHIJEET KUMAR: His article named ‘Demonstration of Facial Emotion Recognition on Real Time Video Using CNN: Python & Keras’ provides the method to train a model and make use of the model to predict the most likely emotion of the user. His work is awesome, and I really appreciate that he shares his work to all the people across the globe. I am now having a brief understanding about how machine learning is like and I will keep investigating when I have time.
